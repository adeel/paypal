This is a very simple Paypal client.  It only works with Paypal's Express Checkout
and Adaptive Payments API's.  The benefit is the clean interface.

It makes use of Pat Collins's client <https://github.com/patcoll/paypal-python> for
the Express Checkout API (it provides a nice wrapper around it).  Thanks to him for
that.

To learn how to use it, check out the code.  It's well documented.

EXAMPLE.

  from paypal import payment

  payment.send(5.00, 'recipient@example.com', 'sender@example.com',
    return_url='http://localhost', cancel_url='http://localhost', options={
      'app_id': ...})

Type help(payment.send) for more explanation.
